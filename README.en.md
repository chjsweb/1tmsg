# 1tmsg · Burn-after-reading secret messages

Send a password, API key, internal link, or a piece of text to someone — **they read it once, and the content on the server is deleted immediately.**

The content is encrypted in your browser; the server only stores an unreadable ciphertext: no account, no server to maintain, no database to install, no monthly fee.

> 💡 **Deploy in 5 minutes, runs within the free tier.** You only need a Cloudflare account; just copy the commands below.

> ⚠️ **Lawful use only.** This project is a self-deployment tool: the author operates no public instance and has no access to any instance's data; users must comply with the laws and regulations of their own jurisdiction. See the **[Legal & Compliance Notice](#legal--compliance-notice)**.

## What it does in 30 seconds

| | |
|---|---|
| **Good for** | Sending one-time passwords, API keys, internal addresses, temporary credentials, or text you don't want lingering in chat history; with image support enabled, screenshots too |
| **Not good for** | Long-term archiving, multi-person collaboration, or scenarios requiring audit trails |
| **How privacy is guaranteed** | The decryption key sits in the link (after the `#`); the browser handles encryption/decryption; the server has neither the key nor the plaintext |
| **How it's destroyed** | Default "burn after reading": opened once, the ciphertext on the server is deleted immediately. You can also set an expiration (up to 7 days), view count (1–100), and access password |

Simply put: **What you type in the box, even Cloudflare cannot see.**

## Pick a version first: do you need image support

**This is the only decision point in the entire deployment: which config file you deploy with is which version you get — both ship with the repo, nothing to copy.**

| | Text only (default) | With images |
|---|---|---|
| Config file | `wrangler.jsonc` | `wrangler.images.jsonc` |
| What you can send | Text, Markdown | Text, Markdown, **images** (single ≤ 10 MB) |
| R2 required | No | Yes —— R2 requires a payment method to enable |

The two configs differ only by one `r2_buckets` declaration: commented out in `wrangler.jsonc`, active in `wrangler.images.jsonc` — **having this block means the image-capable version.**

Image ciphertext is stored in Cloudflare R2 object storage, and enabling R2 requires binding a payment method. Many people don't want to bind a card, so **the default is the text-only one (`wrangler.jsonc`), never touching R2 throughout the entire process.**

"Whether `r2_buckets` is in the config" simultaneously determines three things — whether the R2 binding is declared, whether the frontend builds an image entry, and whether the server accepts image attachment requests — so there's no mismatch of "button in the UI but backend rejects it."

---

## One-click / web / CLI deploy: about 5 minutes

### Preparation

| Need | Notes |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare account (required) | Free sign-up: https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up |
| Git (CLI deploy) | For cloning the repo; if not installed, download from https://git-scm.com |
| Node.js 22+ (CLI deploy) | Run `node -v` in terminal; if not, download LTS from https://nodejs.org |

### Step 1 · Pick a version and deploy (choose one of two tabs)

The two tabs below are each a **complete path**; pick one, expand it, and follow it through. Switch to the "With images" tab if you want to send images — it adds two extra steps (enabling R2 and creating a bucket). See "Pick a version" above for the difference.

> **💡 Tip · one repo, many configs**
>
> Create a `wrangler.<your-name>.jsonc` in your fork and point the deploy at it with `-c`, and you can **deploy the same code as several differently-configured Workers** — only the file name changes, everything else stays put: `npm run deploy -- -c wrangler.test.jsonc`
>
> The file name **must end with `.jsonc`** — wrangler picks the format by extension and silently ignores the whole config otherwise (`npm run deploy` catches this at build time and tells you to rename).
>
> Such files never enter version control (`.gitignore` covers `wrangler*.jsonc`, with only `wrangler.jsonc` and `wrangler.images.jsonc` excepted), so they're **immune to Git**: `git pull` from upstream never conflicts, and your domain and bucket name stay local.
>
> Commonly used to change: custom domain, Worker name, R2 bucket name, the image switch.

<summary>🟦 Text only (default)</summary>

#### One-click deploy:
 [![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/CJSen/1tmsg)

 > The one-click deploy is for trial only and won't receive future updates. It's recommended to use the web deploy or CLI deploy, so you can sync upstream code and update immediately.

#### Web deploy:

Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.

Go to the [Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/) web console,

connect your GitHub account and select the forked repo: the deploy command is `npx wrangler deploy`,

change it to: `npm run deploy`, leave everything else as is.

 <img src="docs/static/cf-workers.png" width="300" alt="Config page">

Click deploy and wait a moment for it to go live.

#### CLI deploy:

**① Clone the repo (the config ships with it — no copying needed; edit `wrangler.jsonc` directly if you want changes)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/1tmsg.git
cd 1tmsg
```

**② Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**③ Log in to Cloudflare**

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

Opens the browser automatically; click **Allow** to authorize.

**④ Deploy**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🟨 With images (needs R2, needs card binding)</summary>

#### One-click deploy
> Not supported for this version — use the web deploy or CLI deploy instead, and enable R2 + create the bucket beforehand, or the deploy will fail.

> ⚠️ Image version: the button auto-creates the R2 bucket, but **your account must have R2 enabled (payment method bound)** first, otherwise the bucket-creation step fails. The text-only version has zero barriers.

#### Web deploy:

Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.

Go to the [Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/) web console,

connect your GitHub account and select the forked repo: the deploy command is `npx wrangler deploy`,

change it to: `npm run deploy -- -c wrangler.images.jsonc`, leave everything else as is.

 <img src="docs/static/cf-workers-images.png" width="300" alt="Config page">

Click deploy and wait a moment for it to go live.

#### CLI deploy:

**① Clone the repo (the image config ships with the repo: `wrangler.images.jsonc` — no copying needed)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/1tmsg.git
cd 1tmsg
```

**② Enable R2 and create a bucket**

Log in to the Cloudflare console, click **R2** on the left → follow the prompts to enable (free tier 10 GB/month, but a payment method is required to enable). Then create a bucket and add a 7-day auto-cleanup fallback:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create 1tmsg-blobs
npx wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle add 1tmsg-blobs expire-old --expire-days 7
```

> ⚠️ Do not make the bucket publicly readable (don't bind a custom domain, don't enable the r2.dev public domain), otherwise "burn after reading" is broken.

**③ Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**④ Log in to Cloudflare**

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

Opens the browser automatically; click **Allow** to authorize.

**⑤ Deploy**

```bash
npm run deploy -- -c wrangler.images.jsonc
```

> Without `-c` it's just `npm run deploy`, using the repo's `wrangler.jsonc`. With `-c`, **the build and the deploy read the same file** (otherwise you get "frontend without images, Worker with R2" — an inconsistent state). The first lines of output print the config in effect and its switches.

</details>

### After completion

The terminal will print your access address, like:

```
https://1tmsg.<your-account>.workers.dev
```

Open it and you're using it. **This address is your service homepage**; share it with whoever needs to use it.

It's recommended to configure a custom domain in the cf workers console for easier memorization and access.

---

## Adjust after deployment

| What you want to do | How |
|---|---|
| **Switch site default language** | Edit `vars.DEFAULT_LOCALE` in `wrangler.jsonc` (`"zh"` / `"en"`, default `zh`), then `npm run deploy` again. The UI is bilingual (Chinese/English); **no automatic browser-language following** — the site language is this value, and visitors can manually switch via the `EN / 中文` button in the top-right (the choice is remembered) |
| **Enable / disable image support** | Add / remove the `r2_buckets` block in `wrangler.jsonc` (enable R2 and create a bucket first before adding), then `npm run deploy`; or just deploy the other config: `npm run deploy -- -c wrangler.images.jsonc` |
| **Use your own domain** | Edit `wrangler.jsonc`, uncomment the `routes` line and replace it with your domain, then `npm run deploy`. The domain must be hosted on Cloudflare; certificate and DNS records are created automatically — **do not** manually add A/CNAME |
| **Change Worker name** | Change `name` in `wrangler.jsonc`. If image support is on, the bucket name in the create command must also stay consistent (or create a different bucket name and sync `bucket_name`) |
| **Disable workers.dev fallback address** | Remove the `workers_dev` line from `wrangler.jsonc`, keeping only the custom domain |
| **Adjust per-message / per-image limits** | Edit the `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` (`MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`, `MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CREATES`) then redeploy. The latter two only matter in the image version. The **total per-message image cap** (50 MB by default) is not a var — it is hardcoded as `MAX_TOTAL_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` in `src/config.ts`, so changing it means editing source |
| **Tighten total image capacity** | Edit `vars.MAX_R2_STORAGE_GB` in `wrangler.jsonc` (**in GB, decimals allowed**, e.g. `"5"` / `"0.5"`, default `"5"`) then redeploy. It caps **how much space the whole service may reserve for messages**: once full, creations with images return `507 storage_capacity_reached` while text-only messages keep working; `"0"` stops accepting images entirely. ⚠️ Before **upgrading a running instance**, check the bucket's current usage in the R2 dashboard (also shown in GB) and put it into `vars.INITIAL_RESERVED_GB` — otherwise existing data counts as zero, effectively handing out 5 GB extra. That seed is applied only when the counter is first created (see "Capacity guard" below) |
| **Configure a report channel** | Edit `vars.ABUSE_CONTACT` in `wrangler.jsonc` (**accepts an email or an `http(s)` URL only**, validated at build time), then `npm run deploy` again. **Leaving it empty hides the report entry in the footer**, and the build log prints a prominent reminder (recommended to fill in); use an address you will keep checking. The footer's "lawful use only…" notice **is built in** and needs no configuration (see "Before going public" below) |
| **Update version** | `git pull && npm run deploy` to overwrite-upgrade. **Keep your own domain, bucket name and switches in a separate config file** (e.g. `wrangler.me.jsonc`, see the tip above) and point `-c` at it — editing `wrangler.jsonc` directly gets overwritten or conflicts on `git pull` |

`wrangler.jsonc` (text only) and `wrangler.images.jsonc` (with images) both **ship with the repo and stay tracked** — one-click deploy relies on them to provision resources. Keep configs that carry your real domain or bucket name in a separate file (e.g. `wrangler.me.jsonc`): `.gitignore` already covers `wrangler*.jsonc`, so those changes stay local.

---

## How to use it

1. **Open your service address**, fill in content (Markdown supported; the image version also lets you paste or drag in images).
2. As needed, choose: **burn after reading** (default on) / expiration time / view count / access password, then click **Create and copy link**.
3. **Send the link to the other party**. They open it once, the content is decrypted and displayed in the browser, then the ciphertext on the server is deleted.

> A forwarded link cannot be recalled — anyone who gets the link can view it. Send it through a trusted channel.

---

## Default limits

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Single image ※ | ≤ 10 MB, up to 8 images |
| Total images ※ | ≤ 50 MB / message (tighter than "10 MB × 8", so this is what really limits the count) |
| Total image capacity ※ | ≤ 5 GB by default (`vars.MAX_R2_STORAGE_GB`, adjustable; once full only text messages can be sent) |
| Text content | ≤ 10 MB |
| Expiration time | 3 minutes – 7 days, default 1 hour |
| View count | 1 – 100, default 5 (available when burn-after-reading is off) |
| Note | ≤ 120 chars |
| Access password | ≥ 6 chars, 10 consecutive wrong attempts destroys the message |
| Creation rate | 30 messages / IP / minute |

> ※ Only present in the image version (`wrangler.images.jsonc`); the text-only version (`wrangler.jsonc`) doesn't use these.

### Capacity guard: total image storage cannot grow without bound

For a public service the real risk is not one oversized message but **unbounded total growth** — with enough IPs and enough time, the bucket just keeps growing. So the image version carries a site-wide ceiling:

- Every creation with images first atomically reserves the **declared image size** in a global counter (`MAX_R2_STORAGE_GB`, default 5 GB). If it does not fit, the request returns `507` and the message is never created.
- When a message is destroyed, times out while uploading, or expires, the reservation is returned — each message returns it **at most once**, never twice.
- The check and the increment are a single atomic operation, so **concurrent creations cannot push the total past the cap**.
- The counter tracks "space already promised", not live R2 usage; real usage is always lower, so seeing "reserved > actually stored" is normal.

The counter lives in its own Durable Object (`StorageGuard`) and is unreachable from the outside. R2 lifecycle rules are still in place as a last resort for stray objects; but **automatic deletion does not notify the Worker**, so reservations are not released that way — they follow the message lifecycle instead.

---

## About security

- **Plaintext only exists in your browser.** Encryption and decryption are completed locally; the server only stores and retrieves ciphertext.
- **The decryption key is placed after the `#` in the link.** The browser spec guarantees this part is never sent to the server, and it's immediately wiped from the address bar after the page opens.
- **A database leak can't reveal content.** An attacker only gets metadata like `ciphertext + expiration + view count`.
- **Zero external dependencies on the page.** No CDN, analytics scripts, external fonts, or images are loaded; all frontend code comes from this project itself.
- **No inline scripts on the service.** Combined with strict CSP and security response headers, third parties can hardly inject anything into the decryption page.
- **The only local storage is language preference.** Only clicking the `EN / 中文` button in the top-right stores a `"zh"` or `"en"` in the browser, containing no message, key, or content; automatic browser-language following writes nothing.

For the complete security model, key derivation method, why images go through object storage separately, and all known trade-offs, see **[docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md)**.

## FAQ

**Q: Does it cost money?**
Free plan is enough: Workers 100k requests/day, Durable Objects 5 GB storage; if image support is enabled, add R2's 10 GB/month (downloads not billed). Usage stays within free tiers, **no automatic charges**, and it errors out instead of generating a bill when exceeded. The text-only version doesn't even need R2, so no card binding.

**Q: Can the server see what I wrote?**
No. The server only stores ciphertext and expiration. But remember: **anyone holding the full link can decrypt it** — that's the purpose of this tool, and it also means a forwarded link can't be recalled.

**Q: I sent the link to the wrong person, what now?**
No one can remotely recall an already-sent link. A viable approach: if the message has a password, the recipient can't open it without it; otherwise wait for it to expire (setting a short expiration is a good habit).

**Q: `wrangler login` stuck or failing?**
Mostly a network issue. Try enabling a proxy and retry, or switch to API Token login (Cloudflare console → My Profile → API Tokens).

**Q: I don't want to bind a card, can I use it?**
Yes, and that's the default path — the text-only version needs no R2 throughout, so no payment method binding. Follow the three steps `npm install && npx wrangler login && npm run deploy`.

**Q: Deployment asks to enable R2, requiring card binding?**
It means the config in use declares `r2_buckets` (i.e., you took the image-capable path). Don't want to bind a card? Go back to the text-only one: remove that `r2_buckets` block, or deploy without `-c` (`npm run deploy` defaults to `wrangler.jsonc`), then run it once more.

**Q: Deployed text-only first, want to add images later?**
Complete R2 enabling and bucket creation as above, copy the `r2_buckets` block from `wrangler.images.jsonc` into `wrangler.jsonc`, or just deploy the image version: `npm run deploy -- -c wrangler.images.jsonc`. Going the other way (from image back to text-only) means **previously sent image messages will have broken images** — the body and note remain viewable, but the image shows a missing placeholder.

**Q: Deploy error says bucket not found?**
The bucket name at creation differs from `bucket_name` in `wrangler.jsonc`. Change both to the same name (default `1tmsg-blobs`).

**Q: Deployment succeeded but page won't open?**
Wait about 30 seconds first (a new Worker needs a moment on first launch); if still not opening, confirm `workers_dev` in `wrangler.jsonc` wasn't removed, and that you're using the address printed by the terminal.

**Q: Local debug creating the 30th message gets 429?**
The local environment shares one IP identifier across all requests, hitting the "30 per minute" creation rate limit. Online buckets by real IP, so this doesn't happen.

**Q: Why do images need separate R2? Can't the database handle it?**
Images are large binaries; stuffing them into the database makes fetching a piece of text also download all images. This project stores **text ciphertext in the database, image ciphertext in object storage**; both are one-time access, security unaffected. Don't want R2? Deploy the text-only version; the loss is only images.

## Local development (optional)

```bash
npm run dev          # build frontend and start local server (http://localhost:8787)
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type check
npm run build        # only build frontend assets
```

`dev` / `build` / `deploy` rebuild the frontend based on the effective config, so what you see locally is what gets deployed. The default is `wrangler.jsonc`; add a `-c` to make **both** the build and the deploy use another file (both links read the same file, so the image switch can never drift apart):

```bash
npm run dev -- -c wrangler.me.jsonc
npm run deploy -- -c wrangler.me.jsonc
```

The text-only config is the default; to preview the image version locally, point `-c` at it:

```bash
npm run dev                              # text only (wrangler.jsonc)
npm run dev -- -c wrangler.images.jsonc  # with images
```

Local debug uses wrangler's local mock storage, **having `r2_buckets` doesn't require actually enabling R2**, no card binding involved.

## Technical details

If you care about how it works — how keys are derived, why an extra `verifier` is stored, how images avoid leaking the recipient's IP, how the `readToken` grace period is designed — see:

- **[docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md)** —— full design spec

Tech stack: TypeScript + Web Crypto, Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (SQLite); with image support enabled, add a private R2 bucket. No VPS, MySQL, or Redis needed.

## Before going public, do these first

> These items **have nothing to do with the author and depend only on the deployer**: the author operates no public instance and cannot reach any data in yours. Whoever you open it up to, the responsibility is yours.

| What to do | How | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Set up an abuse contact** | Make sure the email on your Cloudflare account works, and configure a dedicated abuse contact | Cloudflare's Trust & Safety sends abuse reports (including those forwarded by law enforcement) to **your account email or the abuse contact you configured**. If none is set, or nobody reads it, reports bypass you and go straight upstream; and the official requirement is to respond **within 24 hours** — failing to respond can get content removed, **or even your account's service suspended** |
| **Configure a report channel** | Set `vars.ABUSE_CONTACT` (email or URL, validated at build time). **Leaving it empty hides the report entry in the footer**, and the build log prints a prominent reminder | The footer's "lawful use only…" notice **is already built in** (it follows the UI language); you only need to add one real, working report channel — notice plus channel together are the most direct and the easiest-to-evidence proof that you "gave notice and exercised management responsibility" |
| **Prepare your takedown action** | On receiving a report, run: `curl -X DELETE https://<your-domain>/api/messages/<id>` | This endpoint ships with the project; it destroys the ciphertext and clears the image from object storage. **Remember: ask only for the message id, never for the key after the `#`** — the key is useless for takedown, and the moment you hold it you are no longer the party who "cannot see the content". Without an id there is nothing to locate, so spell out your reporting requirements from the start |
| **Keep a response log** | Record locally: time / source / message id / what you did / how long it took | The page notice and the report channel are visible to anyone; **only this log can prove "I acted on the report I received"**. Keep it locally, not inside the service |
| **Decide your kill switch** | Full stop on creation: `npx wrangler delete` (take the whole Worker offline), or set `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CREATES` to `1` and redeploy | The nuclear option for extreme cases. ⚠️ **Do not set it to `0`** — in the code `0` is treated as "not set" and falls back to the default, which means nothing is actually turned off |

### Additional notes for deployers in different jurisdictions

> The following are reminders only, not legal advice; consult a licensed lawyer in your jurisdiction about your specific situation.

- Deployers are spread across different jurisdictions, so **the project itself hardcodes no jurisdiction's compliance requirements**, and both config options above are off by default — whether to use them is your call.
- Offering an internet information service to the public carries licensing, registration/filing, or content-safety obligations in many jurisdictions. This project runs on Cloudflare's network, collects no accounts and stores no content, but **that does not mean you are exempt** — whether an obligation falls on you depends on where you are, where your recipients are, and how widely you open it up.
- One point to be very clear about: this project is designed as "end-to-end encrypted + burn after reading + no access logs", so **you can neither review content nor answer "who sent this message"**. That means there is little room to reduce your responsibility by "cooperating with an investigation" — what's left is exactly those items above: clear notice, a working report channel, and actually acting on reports.
- If your instance is open to the public, seriously consider narrowing it to people you know (for example, restrict access with Cloudflare Access).
- See the full disclaimer in the [Legal & Compliance Notice](#legal--compliance-notice) below.

## Legal & Compliance Notice

**This project is for lawful use only.** It is a self-deployed open-source tool: the author **operates no public instance and hosts no user data**, has no administrative access to any instance, and cannot access, review, or delete content in instances deployed by others. The decryption key exists only after the `#` in the link (see "About security"), which technically means **no one can review instance content** — therefore **all compliance and legal responsibility rests with the deployer and the user**.

This notice **does not target any particular country or region**: "applicable law" below means the law in force where you and your recipients are located.

By using or deploying this project, you are deemed to have understood and agreed:

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| **No unlawful use** | Do not use it to create, copy, publish, or disseminate any information that violates applicable law, or to engage in any unlawful activity. This includes but is not limited to: content that endangers national security or social stability, terrorism and extremism, violent content, obscenity and pornography, gambling, fraud, pyramid schemes, drugs, or content infringing the lawful rights of others |
| **No unlawful data** | Do not use it to unlawfully obtain, buy, sell, exchange, or publish the personal information, privacy, trade secrets, or undisclosed data of others (such as ID documents, account credentials, contact lists, or location traces). Compliance obligations under applicable laws on personal information protection, data security, and cybersecurity rest with the user |
| **No aiding crime** | Do not use it to provide a transmission or hiding channel for online fraud, money laundering, illegal fundraising, hacking, data theft, or evading supervision |
| **Protection of minors** | Do not send unlawful or harmful information to minors; scenarios involving minors must comply with the provisions on the protection of minors in applicable law |
| **Deployer responsibility** | As the operator of an instance, you may have to bear licensing, registration/filing, content-safety, and log-retention obligations (especially when offering an internet information service to the public); assess these and handle them yourself in accordance with the law, and you alone bear all consequences arising from deploying, operating, or using this software |
| **Cooperating with law enforcement** | If you are the deployer of an instance, you must cooperate with lawful requests from law enforcement yourself. The author hosts no instance and no data, and can neither provide nor delete any content on your behalf |
| **Author's liability** | This project is provided "as is" under the MIT license, without any express or implied warranty. The author is not responsible for anyone's use of this software, nor for any direct or indirect loss or legal liability arising from it |
| **Reporting** | If you find others abusing this project, report it to the relevant platform or law enforcement agency, not to the author — the author has no ability to handle any instance |

This notice is not legal advice; consult a professional lawyer about your specific situation. **If you do not agree with any of the above, do not use or deploy this project.**

If you plan to open your instance to the public, read "Before going public, do these first" above — every item in that checklist protects you better than this notice does.
